					div3: "<ul><li>You can use <b>photos that are already online</b>, such as images stored in a photo sharing site like Flickr or images stored on your own website.

					div9: "The import operation references pictures that are already hosted by storing their URLs in a web map feature collection. The pictures are not stored in ArcGIS Online. If hosted pictures can't be accessed, they won't be available in the Map Tour and you''ll see a 'Picture not available' image. Depending on your photo service provider, the Map Tour may not import the name, description and location of the pictures. Those attributes are stored in the web map and any edits to the online services won't be reflected in the Map Tour.",
					div10: "Storing the pictures on a web server",
					div11: "If you choose to host the pictures yourself, you will have to manually create thumbnails of your pictures.

Although images of different sizes, shapes and orientation can be used in one Map Tour, we recommend using the exact same size and shape for all the images. In this way, the user won't be distracted by different sized images as they follow the tour.",
